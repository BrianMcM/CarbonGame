Carbon city is a complex metropolic teaming with transport options. Four bus routes, three train lines, dozens of bike share stands, and a bustling taxi service give the player tons of routes around town

Your character has 5 minutes to explore the complicated transit systems of Carbon City collecting gems for points. However taking the various forms of transit add differing levels of carbon to the atmoshpere lowering your overall score. Taxi's pollute the most, bikes the least and buses and trains somewhere in the middle.

You must also balance your energy levels, so you cant just walk and bike everywhere. 

The game uses grid based pathfinding to move around so its entirely playable with just a mouse.

Good luck, and thanks for reading!
